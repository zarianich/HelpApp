I love you, you are such a good person. You will be okay. Those people are not judging you, you just have an emotional reaction because of past trauma, but it’s in the past now. You are safe, don’t worry. You can always rely on me, I will always have your back. Come to me any time, I will always be here. I love you so much. Keep breathing deeply and squeezing your hands for as much as you have to until you feel better. The attack will stop, I promise you, you will feel better. I love you <3";

export const hopelessText = "I understand, life can be extremely cruel, even if we don't deserve it. You may feel broken or lifeless. Please, try to breathe, lay down if you have to, for as much time as you need. Feel your breath, close your eyes if you want to. Just breathe for a little. Now try to think about what you would do if you could do anything in the world. Have you ever had dreams? Think about them, please. You can also think about this: is there something, something small, that would make you smile? How about ice cream? Do you like watching nature? Try to do that for me, please. And remember, I love you and will always be here for you, you can come to me anytime <3";

Remember to breathe deeply and take care of yourself. I love you soooo much xx <3<3";

export const motivationText = "I understand, you feel down, drained of energy, you want to do work, but your body just tells you to go to sleep. This is completely normal. Motivation is actually a myth. That rush, urge, energetic feeling you get that really makes you want to work on something usually only comes in extreme conditions like survival mode or after success. But constantly going into survival mode isn't healthy for you, so please don't do that. And relying on success to fuel you is, well, unreliable, because it is outside of your control. If you want to do something, you need to just do it, even if you feel bad. That is a very valuable skill to have and it will actually increase your chance of success, because you did the work. So do it, do it crying, do it powerless, just do it. Damn, nike is really onto someting... Anyways, I wish you good luck and love you bye xx <3 <3";

export const lookForwardText = "I understand, life can be very harsh very often and that can make you lose all interest and hope in it, and make you feel like there is nothing to look forward to, right? I totally understand how that feels, it sucks. What you can try to do is sit down, or even lay down, and close your eyes (or don't), now try to breathe deeply. Just breathe for a little, try to not think about anything, focus on your breath. Do that for as much as you need to. You will feel better, at least a little, I promise you. Now, please, try to think of something easy that you like to do. It can be eating snacks, watching your favorite show, maybe even talking to someone. If you have no one to talk to or don't want to talk to anyone, that's okay, it happens. Please remember that you're a good person and you will find your people eventually. Now just try to do one of the easy things I mentioned or something you came up with on your own. Take it slow, one step at a time, and remember to always love and take care of yourself. I will forever be here for you, you can rely on me. I love you soooo much, hugs and kisses xx <3<3";
